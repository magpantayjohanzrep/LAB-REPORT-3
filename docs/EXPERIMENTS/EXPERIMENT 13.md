# EXPERIMENT 13 - PCM DECODING 

# OVERVIEW 🔍
- Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) is a fundamental system used to convert message signals into a continuous serial stream of binary numbers, a process known as encoding. The recovery of the original message from this digital stream is referred to as decoding. At its most basic level, the decoding process requires identifying new frames within the data stream, extracting the binary numbers, and generating a proportional voltage for each value. This voltage is held until the next frame is decoded, creating a Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) version of the original signal, which is then passed through a low-pass filter for final reconstruction. Successful decoding relies heavily on maintaining a clock frequency identical to the encoder's and correctly detecting the beginning of each frame to avoid data misinterpretation.

# OBJECTIVES 📝
- The primary objective of this experiment is to gain practical experience with PCM decoding using the Emona Telecoms-Trainer 101. Students will aim to convert both a sinewave and speech signals into a PCM data stream and subsequently decode them back into PAM signals. A key focus of the exercise is to understand the necessity of "stealing" the clock and frame synchronization signals from the encoder to ensure the decoder operates correctly. Additionally, the experiment objective includes recovering the original message signals using a Tuneable Low-pass filter module and comparing the auditory and visual differences between the decoded output and the original source.

# PART A - Setting up the PCM encoder📌

- The initial setup demonstrates the conversion of a static analog level into a digital format. With the Variable DCV module connected to the PCM Encoder, the oscilloscope displays the Frame Synchronization (FS) pulse on Channel 1 and the PCM DATA stream on Channel 2. The FS pulse acts as a critical timing reference, marking the start of each 8-bit data frame.
  
- We observed that as the Variable DCV control is manually adjusted, the binary bit pattern within the PCM DATA stream changes dynamically. A higher positive DC voltage results in a bit pattern approaching 11111111, while a negative voltage moves the pattern toward 00000000. This confirms that the encoder is successfully quantizing the DC input into a specific 8-bit serial code that represents the signal's instantaneous magnitude.

- Unlike the stable binary pattern observed with the DC signal, the PCM DATA stream shown on the oscilloscope becomes dynamic and highly complex. Since the input sinewave's amplitude is constantly changing, the encoder generates a different 8-bit binary code for each successive sample frame to accurately represent the instantaneous voltage level.
  
- Consequently, the digital bit stream on the scope appears as a rapidly shifting sequence of pulses. Amidst this changing data, the Frame Synchronization (FS) pulse remains a steady and periodic reference, marking the beginning of each new 8-bit word. This demonstrates the encoder's process of sampling a continuously varying analog signal and converting it into a serial stream of discrete digital values.

# PART B - Decoding the PCM data📌

- Based on the output waveform corresponding to Figure 5 in Part B, we observed that the signal generated by the PCM Decoder is not yet a smooth reconstruction of the original message. Instead, we observed a distinct "stepped" or staircase waveform on Channel 1, which follows the general shape of the original 2kHz sine wave displayed on Channel 2.

- We observed that this "blocky" appearance is characteristic of a Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) signal. This effect occurs because the decoder converts each 8-bit binary word back into a specific voltage level and holds that voltage constant for the entire duration of the sampling frame. Consequently, we observed that while the decoded signal accurately represents the amplitude of the original message at discrete points, it requires further filtering to smooth out the steps and restore the continuous analog waveform.

# PART C - Encoding and Decoding Speech📌

# WHEN THERE IS VOICE PRESENT 🗣️ 
![output](https://github.com/magpantayjohanzrep/LAB-REPORT-3/blob/55a7b67935a65d659fb09ac8bb0e990312f02bcf/docs/images/627380713_784853667995063_5370392027045873657_n.jpg)

- We observed that when no one is speaking into the microphone, the output waveform on the oscilloscope is not a flat line (0V). Instead, we observed a distinct, random "stepped" pattern or low-level noise. This occurs because the PCM encoder is still sampling the background noise and the internal electrical noise of the microphone amplifier. The encoder quantizes these low-level signals into binary values, which the decoder then reconstructs as small, random voltage steps.
  
- In contrast, when we observed the waveform while talking into the microphone, the "stepped" PAM signal fluctuates wildly and significantly increases in amplitude, following the complex rhythm and intensity of the speech. We observed that these large voltage steps correspond to the high variations in the voice signal, which are then smoothed by the low-pass filter to reproduce the audible speech.

# PART D - Recovering the message📌

- Based on the experimental arrangement in Figure 10 of Part D, where the system was set up to encode and decode human speech, we observed distinct characteristics in both the resulting waveform and the auditory output. In this setup, the PCM Decoder received its clock and frame synchronization signals directly from the Master Signals module, ensuring perfect timing.

- Consequently, on the oscilloscope connected after the Tuneable Low-pass Filter, we observed a highly complex and dynamic analog waveform that fluctuated unpredictably, faithfully tracking the varied variations of the speech input rather than a repetitive pattern. Furthermore, by monitoring the output through headphones connected to the buffer, we observed that the reconstructed speech was clearly intelligible. This confirmed that with correct synchronization and appropriate filtering, the PCM system successfully recovered the complex analog voice message from the digital data stream.

# PART A TO D QUESTIONS 📝

Question 1: What does the PCM Decoder's "stepped" output tell you about the type of signal that it is?

- Answer: The "stepped" output indicates that the signal is a Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) signal. The PCM decoder converts each binary number from the data stream into a proportional voltage and holds that voltage constant until the next frame is decoded. This "holding" action creates the characteristic steps, forming a PAM version of the original message before it is smoothed out by a filter.

Question 2: What must be done to the PCM Decoder module's output to reconstruct the message properly?

- Answer: To reconstruct the message properly, the decoder's output (the PAM signal) must be passed through a low-pass filter. The stepped PAM signal contains the original message plus high-frequency components (the "steps"). The low-pass filter removes these high-frequency components, smoothing the waveform to recover the original analog message.

Question 3: Even though the two signals look and sound the same, why isn't the reconstructed message a perfect copy of the original message?

- Answer: The reconstructed message is not a perfect copy of the original due to Quantization Error (or Quantization Distortion).  The manual explains that the PCM Encoder module works with 8-bit binary numbers. This means the continuous analog message (which has an infinite number of possible voltage levels) is mapped to a finite set of discrete levels.
  
- Because the encoder must round the actual voltage of the message to the nearest available binary value, there is a small discrepancy between the original signal and the digitized version. This discrepancy is the quantization error, which results in a reconstructed signal that is very close to, but not identical to, the original.

# Reflection/Learning Summary 💡

# The Digital-to-Analog Process:

- We learned that decoding is essentially a multi-step translation. It begins with identifying binary frames (synchronization), converting those bits into discrete voltage levels (quantization), and holding those levels to form a "stepped" Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) signal. This helped us visualize that a "digital" signal, before final filtering, is actually a series of discrete analog steps rather than a smooth continuous curve.

# The Importance of Synchronization:

- A major takeaway was the absolute necessity of synchronization. The experiment highlighted that for the decoder to work, it must "speak the same language" as the encoder—meaning it requires the exact same Clock frequency and Frame Synchronization (FS) signals. Without these "stolen" signals from the encoder, the decoder would misinterpret the binary stream, resulting in garbled noise rather than a coherent message.

# The Role of Filtering:

- We observed that the raw output of a PCM decoder is "blocky" or "stepped" (PAM). The experiment clarified the role of the Low-Pass Filter as a reconstruction tool. By filtering out the high-frequency components (the sharp edges of the steps), the filter smoothed the signal, restoring the original analog shape (sine wave or speech) and making it intelligible.

# Quantization Reality:

Finally, the experiment demonstrated the concept of Quantization Error. Even with correct synchronization and filtering, we realized that the reconstructed signal is never a perfect mathematical copy of the original. Because we are mapping infinite analog values to a finite 8-bit scale (256 levels), there is always a small margin of error. This was audible as subtle differences in the speech quality or visible as slight imperfections in the waveform, reinforcing the trade-offs inherent in digital communication systems.
